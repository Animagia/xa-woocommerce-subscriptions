WooCommerce Subscriptions Plugin to create Subscription Products and Manage Subscriptions. Supports PayPal and Stripe.

== Description ==

Subscriptions are a great way to ensure regular revenue from your WooCommerce store. This WooCommerce extension helps you create simple subscriptions on your store. You can create subscriptions out of physical, downloadable or virtual products. The subscriptions can be of different billing periods and intervals. 

Once you install the plugin, you can create subscription products just like you create any other WooCommerce products. The plugin will add a field in the product type drop-down - 'simple subscription'  which you can choose accordingly. You can further add the terms for subscriptions and the renewal cycles in the Product Data settings.

On the plugin settings tab, you can configure the text displayed on the front-end and allow mixed checkout to customers. Here you can change the My Account tab name, Page Title, add-to-cart Button Text and Place Order Button Text. 


**Features of Subscriptions for WooCommerce:**

A choice to schedule an interval from the 1st to 6th of these billing periods is also available.

* Display subscription products along with individual products on your Shop page. Your customers can choose to opt for a subscription according to their preference (based on the subscription plans that you set up). However, customers need to register on your store to initiate a subscription.

**Recurring Payments**

We support most payments gateways which support subscription payments. This includes Stripe, Paypal, Authorize.net, Amazon Pay and Apple Pay.

Recurring payment is a transaction which occurs periodically over the time. When you buy a product or service which comes with a recurring payment option, it involves authorising the store owner to collect the required charges from your credit card or bank account on the due date of every billing cycle.

**How WooCommerce Subscriptions handle recurring payments?**

Since recurring payments are bound to repeat after completion of billing cycle, WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin makes sure a new order is placed as soon as the due date is reached.
This allows you to get notification on completion of due date and if the permission is given (in case of Direct Bank Transfer) the charges are deducted from customer's bank account.

**How WooCommerce Subscriptions helps you to start a Subscription Business Website?**

Our WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin helps you set up different types of subscription commerce websites.

Convenience Commerce Receiving the same products automatically on a repeat purchase basis.
Discovery Commerce Helps consumers discover and sample new products they might not have otherwise known about.

The most popular subscription commerce model currently is subscription boxes. Every month, week or year customers pay a subscription fee to receive products personally delivered to them in a box. Be it cosmetics, male grooming products, pet food or movies, mystery and surprise nearly always plays a role as you don't always know what you are going to receive. 

Subscription Commerce is also known as 'Subcom'. There a few different names for Subscription Commerce. 'Subscription box' is the most frequently used and best known. Other terms include things like 'lazy boxes' and even 'sample boxes' or 'replenishment boxes'. Industry insiders usually refer subscription commerce as 'subcom'

Successful subscription boxes are those who have targeted a specific niche. You can start and run below types of subscription box business. 

Beauty & Fashion Subscription
Books Subscription
Women Subscription
Men Subscription
Kids Subscription
Baby Subscription
Food Subscription
Beverage Subscription
Geek Subscription 
Gaming Subscription
Fitness Subscription 
Outdoors Subscription
Family Subscription
Art & Culture Subscription
Pets Subscription
Home & Living Subscription
Novelty Subscription
Green Subscription
Crafts, DIY, & Hobby Subscription

All these types of businesses 
This clearly shows the potential in the field of online subscription business as well as its effect on people.

Gourmet food samples, pet stuff, manly grooming products and of course cosmetics. Everywhere you look nowadays you see people receiving membership boxes in the mail.

Because the benefits of creating your own subscription or membership box company are invaluable and the concept is so simple; customers pay a subscription fee that varies from quarterly to monthly, weekly and even daily, and they receive a product or a range of products they love on a recurring basis. 

Nowadays it costs near nothing to set up a website and begin taking recurring payments from your customers. With Wordpress, WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin you can setup a subscriptions website in hours. You don't always even need to pay for stock upfront, you can look at drop shipping or even sourcing products on credit. 

You send your customers through a sales checkout process just the one time and turn that one off purchase into guaranteed monthly recurring billing with a subscription e-commerce model.

With a subscription box business you can predict the volume of orders you'll need to fulfill and send out in a given period. The result means that you can plan your stock and inventory easier and reduce wastage. 

Also, the retention rates play a key role in the profitability of a successful subscription commerce business. There are so many options when it comes to retail be it food, fashion, technology or anything else you can purchase. We are entering into a phase of 'curation' both online and offline. Technology empowered more people to set up shop and sell a physical or digital product. But we are often overwhelmed with the amount of choice when looking to make a purchase of some kind. Subscription boxes solve this problem. The items in the box are usually specially curated to suit your customers lifestyle, needs or preferences.  Subscription box businesses are like personal shoppers.

Figure out your subscription box service and you'll have a fully automated recurring revenue generating business. After your customer makes their first purchase, whether paying in full or recurring payments they simply receive the box with a smile on their face and thats it. 

We will keep on working on our WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin to empower your recurring revenue business.
